    <h3>How To Use</h3>
      <table class="table table-bordered table-striped">
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td><strong>Symbol Buttons</strong></td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>The symbol buttons located below the search text box can be used to find more general results.
            Tap on one of the buttons to insert it into your search text. The # symbol represents any numeric
            character (0-9). The * symbol represents 0 or more characters of any type, including white space.
            The _ symbol represents one single character of any type, including white space.
            <br/><br/>
            Examples:<br/>
            If you entered in the search box "number ###", it would find anything with the word number, followed
            by a space, followed by three numerals. "number 123" would match this, as would "number 000" or 
            "number 198", but "number 09" would not.<br/>
            If you entered in the search box "some*", it would find anything with the word "some" followed by any
            other characters. "some" would match this, as would "something." and "something else I already said",
            but "som" would not.<br/>
            If you entered in the search box "ra_er", it would find anything starting with the letters "ra", 
            followed by any single character, followed by "er". "racer", "rager", and "ra!er" would all match this,
            but "rather" would not.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><strong>Message Source</strong></td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>To search Facebook or Twitter messages, you must have that service enabled on this device. To enable,
            press the menu button and go to Settings. Click on the "Log In" button for the service you wish to enable.
            It will prompt you for your username and password for that service. For Facebook, it will also prompt you
            to accept our permissions. Do so - we promise not to abuse your privacy!<br/>
            Once you have logged in, you will be able to search messages from that source. To do so, simply click the
            icon for whichever sources you wish to search on the search screen. The Facebook icon is the "f", Twitter
            is the "t". The SMS is for text messages, and the star is for messages that you have previously starred.<br/>
            The message source icon is also displayed next to search results.
