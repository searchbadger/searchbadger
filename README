*Note:* Do not touch the emulator when it loads. Wait for it to get to the home
       screen, then in the main Eclipse application, a JUnit tab will open and
       begin running the tests. You can easily see which pass and which fail. 
	  
	     By double clicking on the failing tests in the Junit tab, you can open the file
	     where an assertion has failed and it will be highlighted. In the Failure Trace
	     portion of the Junit tab, you can see what the expected and actual values of
	     the assertion are. All of the tests will run even if some fail.
